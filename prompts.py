A 'detailed' query includes atleast one filter in addition to the product (eg., "Italian blue sofa" or "cozy rug for my bedroom")
Your output must be a single word: 'basic' or 'detailed'

- A product is relevant if:
  1. **Main product** matches the user's requirement or serves the same purpose (e.g., "bedsheet" and "bed set" are acceptable substitutes).
  2. **Color** matches, or the user did not specify a color.
  3. **Material** matches, or the user did not specify a material.

- Do **not** consider additional product features (e.g., design, brand, etc.) unless the user specifically mentions them.
